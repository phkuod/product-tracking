**Main Branch**: `master` (for pull requests)

### After Any Enhancement
1. **Commit Changes**: Create descriptive commit messages
2. **Push to Dev**: Push changes to remote dev branch
3. **Create PR**: Create pull request from dev to master

### Commands
```cmd
# Check current status
git status

# Add and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: descriptive commit message"

# Push to remote dev branch
git push origin dev

# Create pull request (using GitHub CLI)
gh pr create --title "Feature: Description" --body "Enhancement details" --base master --head dev
```

### Quick Start (Windows)
```cmd
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Stop any running development server (if needed)
# Use Ctrl+C in the terminal running the server, or:
# taskkill /f /im node.exe (kills all Node processes - use with caution)

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open browser (in new terminal/command prompt)
# Note: Port may vary (5173, 5174, 5175, etc.) if default port is in use
start http://localhost:5173

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### Development Server Management
```cmd
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Stop development server
# Method 1: Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where server is running
# Method 2: Close the terminal window
# Method 3: Kill all Node processes (use carefully)
taskkill /f /im node.exe
# Method 4: Kill specific Vite ports (recommended)
npx kill-port 5173 5174 5175 5176 5177 5178 5179

# Check if specific port is in use
netstat -ano | findstr :5173

# Kill specific process by PID (if needed)
taskkill /f /PID <process_id>
```

### Available Scripts (Windows)
- `npm run dev`: Start development server with hot reload (auto-detects available port)
- `npm run build`: Create production build
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint for code quality
- `npm run preview`: Preview production build locally
- `start http://localhost:5173`: Open application in default browser (adjust port as needed)
